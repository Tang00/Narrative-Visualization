  <h1>Average Car Prices by Year</h1>
  <p id="description">
    How do external and internal factors effect the price of a used car? <br>
    Following the 2008 financial crisis, used car prices began to steadily increase. This rise was influenced by decreased new car production and increased demand for affordable vehicles. <br>
    In 2011, there was a particularly sharp uptick in used car prices compared to the previous years.
