    <h1>Average Price of Selected Vehicle</h1>
    <p id="description">
      Whether due to popularity or an image of reliability, some vehicles retain
      their value better than others.<br />
      For example, the Ford F-150 seems to hold a value of around $4000 at 200k
      miles, nearly double the average. <br />
      Select a vehicle from the dropdown to see its price change as its
      mileage increases.
