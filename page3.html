  <h1>Average Price by Odometer</h1>
  <p id="description">
    The odometer reading of a vehicle directly relates to it's price. As vehicles accumulate mileage, their resale value typically declines, reflecting depreciation and wear.<br>
    However, as the odometer increases, the price tapers off to a consistent value.
